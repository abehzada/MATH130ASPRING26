<p><b>Textbook:</b>&nbsp; There is no required textbook. The recommended textbooks are

<ul>


<li><i>Understanding Analysis</i> by  Stephen Abbott ; published by Springer.</li><br>

<li><i>Real Analysis: A Long-Form Mathematics Textbook</i> by Jay Cummings.</li><br>

<li><i>Advanced Calculus</i> (2nd Revised edition)  by   Patrick M. Fitzpatrick; published by American Mathematical Society.</li>

</ul>
You should regard the notes you take in class as your primary source; 
the textbook is a companion source, for those moments when I have been incomplete in class, 
or when you want to read further in a topic that interests you.
</p>


			
			
<p><b>Homework:</b>&nbsp; Homework is a very important part of the course and in order to fully 
          master the topics it is essential that you work carefully on every assignment and 
           try your best to complete every problem. The homework assignments will be announced on the course  
 <a href="homework.html">homework page</a>. 
 You should make 
every effort to complete the homework assignments and seek help with problems you have not been able to solve. Assignments should be submitted through Gradescope.
<ul>
<li>Late homework will not be accepted. </li>
<li>You will be able to access Gradescope through the course Canvas page.</li>
</ul>


</p>







			

                   
			<p>
			<b>Course Readings:</b>&nbsp; Please carefully study the lecture notes of the previous lecture at least twice
                           before the next lecture and bring your questions to my <a href="office_hours.html">office hours</a>. There is nothing that I like more than answering your questions about the material covered in Math 130A. Reviewing the material covered in
                           the previous lesson will provide a framework to which the new information can be attached in the next lesson.
                           Research has proven that new information can be more easily understood when it can be integrated with previous information 
                           and organized into larger schemata.   
                        I recommend that you summarize the key points that are taught in each lecture on a separate sheet of paper.
      			</p>

			
			<p>		
<b>Video Lectures:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp  In addition to the course notes that will be posted on our course Canvas page, if everything goes as planned, a video recording of each lecture will also be uploaded a few hours after class. These videos are a valuable resource, and I encourage you to take full advantage of them, especially if you need to revisit a concept for better understanding, missed a class due to unforeseen circumstances, or want to review material while studying for exams. Watching the videos alongside the notes can help reinforce your learning and ensure you stay on track throughout the course.
</p>






			<p>
                    <b>Attendance:</b> I personally always come to class at least 10 minutes before 
the start of the class. 
Your assumption should be that you are a responsible teacher 
 who is teaching the course. So it does not make sense to miss any class or arrive late or leave early. 
<b>Attendance is worth 5 points</b>; lectures for which attendance data is recorded will be weighted equally.  
<!--You will receive the attendance score 
 for each lecture if you are fully present in the lecture from the beginning to end--> 
 <!--Zoom offers the ability to get attendance information (join time, leave time, etc.).--> 
In order to receive the attendance score, please arrive on time (it will help if 
you make sure to be in class at least 5 minutes early), give correct answers to the questions asked in class, and please do not leave class early. 
<b>Missing more than five lectures will result in an automatic "F" in the course (if you miss more than five lectures, 
    then your course letter grade will be F)</b>. This policy may appear to be harsh, 
but please know that the aim of our attendance policy is by no means to add to your stress. 
 The goal is to ensure that everyone is keeping up with the course. 
Many of us have the habit of procrastination. It has been repeatedly proven to me 
 that it is less likely for my students to fall behind if they attend the lectures. 
Your education is of paramount importance and I care about you and your education.
 
                    </p>

<ul>
<li>
                    <b>Note:</b> There is no need to email me if you miss a lecture. 
Each missed lecture will be counted as one of the five lectures you are allowed to miss. 
If you miss more than five lectures, then your course letter grade will be F. 
                    </li> 
<br>
                    <li>
                    <b>Note:</b> If exceptional circumstances beyond your control require you to miss more than five lectures, please contact me as soon as possible. Depending on the situation, I may waive the maximum five absences policy. Together, we may be able to develop a plan to help you stay on track and succeed in this course before it becomes too late to address any challenges. More generally, if you ever face circumstances beyond your control that could affect your ability to study for this course or cause you to miss multiple lectures, please reach out to me as soon as possible. 
                    </li>

			<b> Announcements:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  It is absolutely essential that you check your 
Sac State email and course announcements on Canvas at least once a day.  
I may give you important information with 24 hours' notice. Also please 
check our course <a href="homework.html">homework page</a> regularly for possible updates.

                 <p><b>Exams:</b>&nbsp; There will be six midterm exams and a final exam. The exams will be either 
 in-class or take-home (this will be decided later).   
 For take-home exams you may be contacted after the exams have been graded to set up a zoom meeting to eliminate any cheating suspicions.
            
                  
                            
                  
                <ul>
			<li>Midterm Exams: Every other Thursday starting with Thursday of Week 2</li>
                        <li>Final Exam: Tuesday 05/19/2026 (10:15am-12:15pm)</li>
                        	
                        <!--<li>Final Exam, Section 2: Wednesday 05/17/2023 (8-10 am)</li>-->
                        
               </ul>




                      </p>
			

			

                <p>
			<b>Grading:</b>&nbsp;   
                         Your <b>Math 130A</b> weighted average will be calculated as follows:
			<ul>
			    <li>5% Attendance, &nbsp;10% Homework, &nbsp; 45% Midterm Exams,   &nbsp; 40% Final Exam</li>
			</ul>
                      

 

			
                    
                      
                   After your weighted average is calculated, letter grades will be assigned based on the following grading scale:</p>
			
			<center>  
                   <table class="grades" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

			</center>

			<br>

                        
In addition, 
<li><b>you must pass the final examination (score&ge;60) in order to pass the course</b>,</li>
<li><b>your average score on midterm exams must be greater than or equal to 60 (out of 100) in order to pass the course</b>,</li>
<li><b>your average score on any two consecutive homework assignments must be greater than or equal to 50 (out of 100) in order to pass the course</b>,</li>
<li><b>you must receive a perfect score on the "Syllabus/Introductory Email Quiz" to pass the course</b>; if you do not receive perfect score in the syllabus quiz, your course letter grade will be F (or you will be automatically dropped from the course),</li>
<li> <b>according to the University's grading policy, a grade of "C-" or better is required for prerequisite courses</b>.</li>

<!--<li><b>you must receive a perfect score on the "Prerequisite Exam" to pass the course.</b> The prerequisite exam will be given on week 1. The purpose of this exam is to ensure that students start out with a solid grasp of the prerequisites.</li>-->
<br>
			<b>There will be no curve</b>. Your score will be solely based on 
your own performance and not how others perform in class. Also your final percentage grade will NOT be rounded up. 
So 94.9999% is an A-. Please do not be more concerned with your grade than with what 
you learn. Remember "Grades don't measure 
your intelligence, age doesn't define 
 your maturity and disabilities don't define your worth."


			</p>

						
			</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Please notice that outside factors, including the need for a certain grade for admission/retention in any academic program, scholarship 
 or transfer credit, graduation requirements or personal desire for a specific grade DO NOT appear in the above calculations. 
Your letter grade will be determined solely based on your performance as described above. Financial aid status, delay in graduation, etc. 
cannot be used as reasons for a grade change. Such requests are absolutely unacceptable and 
will be processed as a form of academic dishonesty. 
</p>

<p><b>Grade Recording Errors</b>:&nbsp; This course will have a Gradescope page; 
your homework and midterm grades will be recorded on the Gradescope page (or the Canvas page) for our class. Please always make sure that your grades have been 
inputted and 
inputted correctly.  <b>In particular, if there is 
any mistake in the recording of your exam or homework scores, you <font color ="ff2222">must</font> notify me within 
two days after the score was posted to Gradescope page (or the Canvas page) for our class (otherwise your request will not be considered). 
 <!--Also requests will not be considered after two days of the date when the assignment or 
exam was first made available for pickup .--></b></p>
						

<p><b>Make-up Exams:</b>&nbsp; Make-up exams will not be given.  You cannot take any exam early or late. In particular, it is your responsibility to ensure
                     that you do not have a schedule conflict involving the final examination; you should not enroll in
                     this class if you cannot take the final exam at the scheduled time.</p>
						
			<!--<ul class="a">
			<li><i><b>The use of electronic devices will not be permitted during exams.</b></i></li>
			</ul>-->
			</p>

<p><b>Extra Credit:</b>&nbsp; Almost every pen-and-paper homework assignment includes some questions marked in bold. You will get extra credit if you come to my <a href="office_hours.html"> office hours</a> 
            and explain your solutions to the bold questions of the week.
            For each successful presentation you will earn 1/2 point extra credit which will be added directly 
to your final grade. 
</p>		


<p><b>Be on Time:</b>&nbsp; Please arrive on time; in fact, it will help if you make sure to be in class
 at least 5 minutes early.  Also please do not leave class early. 

 <p><b>Office Hours:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have scheduled a large number of <a href="office_hours.html">office hours</a>. Study the lecture notes regularly and make sure to bring your questions to my office hours.
There is nothing that I like more than talking with you about math. In the unlikely case that 
all my office hours will conflict with your classes, you must let me know 
by the end of Week 1 so 
that we investigate the issue and possibly schedule even more office hours.
<!--If your schedule does not allow you to attend any of my <a href="office_hours.html">office hours</a> 
to ask your questions, you MUST NOT enroll in this class.-->

<p><b>How to Succeed in My Course:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The main purpose of my Math 130A class is not 
to measure how smart 
you are compared to others. Your grades will not be curved and your score will be solely based on your own performance 
and not how others perform in class.
The main objective of my class is to ensure that you will learn the basics of mathematical analysis,  
and to achieve that goal it is absolutely essential that you do the following:

<ul>
<li>1- Please make every effort to attend every single class and remain actively engaged through attentive listening and participation. It is essential that you arrive on time and stay until the class ends. Asking questions and sharing your thoughts or ideas—even if they are not entirely correct—can be invaluable for deepening your understanding of the topics and fostering meaningful discussions with your peers and me.
</li>


<li>2- Please carefully study the lecture notes of the previous lecture at least twice
   before the next lecture and bring your questions to my <a href="office_hours.html">office hours</a>.  
Please study every lecture line by line 
 and try to understand every detail.  Please make sure that you fully understand the meaning of each statement and 
the purpose of each single 
statement in the lecture notes and bring your questions to my <a href="office_hours.html">office hours</a>.</li>

<li>3- You must spend adequate time on each homework assignment and bring your questions to 
my <a href="office_hours.html">office hours</a>.</li>

<li>4- It is essential that you keep your cellphone away while studying individually or in groups for this class.</li>

</ul>


Please click <a href="https://webpages.csus.edu/a.behzadan/MATH45SPRING26/How_To_Succeed.pdf">here</a> for a list of excellent guidelines on how to succeed in a math class. Additionally, the <a href="https://www.csus.edu/college/natural-sciences-mathematics/center-science-math-success/commit-study.html">Commit to Study program</a> is a peer mentoring initiative designed to help students enhance their study skills. I encourage you to take full advantage of these wonderful resources available to us on campus.

</p>

 			
 <p><b>Spend Sufficient Time on the Course:</b>&nbsp; <!--According to the policy of UCSD's Academic Senate, 
"The value of a course in units . . . shall be reckoned at the rate of one unit for three hours' 
work per week per quarter on the part of the student."--> Since Math 130A is worth 3 credits, 
you should be willing to spend at least 9 hours per week 
on the course during a regular semester.</p>

<p><b>Electronic Devices:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
 <font color ="ff2222"><b>Please do <b>NOT</b> use devices such as laptops, tablets, cell phones for 
non-class-related purposes while in class.</b></font>
<!--It is very distracting to students around you if you are using Facebook, Twitter, email, etc. during class. 
Also the use of electronic devices will <b>NOT</b> be permitted during exams.--> </p>


			
<p><b>Academic Dishonesty:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Academic dishonesty is considered a serious offense at CSUS.&nbsp; 
All problems in exams should be solved using terminology, ideas, and methods that were introduced in lecture. If in any of your solutions you use ideas, notation, or techniques that have not been discussed in lecture, that will be considered as cheating.&nbsp; 
Students caught cheating will face an administrative sanction which may include suspension or expulsion from the university.
&nbsp; It is in your best interest to maintain your academic integrity. 
(<a href="https://www.csus.edu/student-affairs/student-conduct/academic-dishonesty.html">Click here</a> for more information.)
</p>
                   
           <p><b>Lastly,</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that we are so incredibly fortunate to live in this wonderful place 
and have the opportunity to work or study at CSUS. If you share this sentiment, 
 if you believe in the power of honesty and integrity, 
if you believe in the power of hard work and determination, and if you believe in lifting people up and not tearing them down, 
please do take my class. I will stop at nothing to help you succeed
 in this class.</p>
